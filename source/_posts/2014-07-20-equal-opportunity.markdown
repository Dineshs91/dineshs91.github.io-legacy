I've been looking at jobs section in a number of websites and I found out something interesting. All of them
have outlined the skills they are looking for, the amount of experience needed etc. And the dumbest requirement I 
found is a degree in computer science, worst of all some sites mentioned that a degree in computer science from
premium institutes is neede. This is absolutely insane. Analyzing their needs it's very clear that equal 
opportunity is not given. They are clearly biased towards some institutions. They think that people who do their 
degree's in those premium institutes are the best ones and the students who do their degree's in other institutions 
are worthless.

It makes me very sad to see how the world is being shaped. Do grade's have anything to do with skill. I think 
it's not. There are some people in the world who just don't care about grade's, but care very much about knowledge.
There are brilliant people from other universities also. The number can be less, but still they are clearly ignoring
talent. They don't want to take pain. They just want to take the well known path.  

I very much believe that education has nothing to do with a person's skill/talent. All that is required is the 
right thinking and motivation. The whole world is driven by money, who want's to risk it. They just hire people from premium institutions, just to be on the safer side.

First entrepreneurs thinking should change. They are filtering people in wrong ways. Itâ€™s absolutely fine if you reject someone in an interview, but rejecting at the first step, is 
bad. Hope this situation changes.
