If you are learning python then you got to try google app engine(GAE). Google app engine provides a infrastructure for hosting your web app. You must be knowing some html to play with it. If you have a google account, well and good otherwise create it. You need it to host your web app. Download google app engine(python) to your computer. This lets you test your app locally. You can deploy directly from the software itself. There is a course in udacity which teaches web development. It teaches it with the help of GAE If you want to have greater insight into the topic check the google developer site. You can use 10 apps for free and after that you have to pay. Creating a web app can be fun way to explore both python and web development. I agree that GAE doesn't require complex python but it's worth  a try if you are interested in web development.

Note: Use GAE for python.
