Exactly a year ago, I got my macbook pro 13’ version. It has a special place in my life.
Trust me, it made my life easier. I would say, it’s definitely worth it. I never had to 
worry about it. It just works. I do not even shut it down for a month or more. But it never showed a hint of failure. I remember my days with windows, where most of the time I kept cursing it. Using a mac, I just had to worry about the things I was trying to accomplish and never about the laptop itself. One more thing I liked is the terminal. 
Without terminal I would not have bought a mac. So if you want this kind of experience, get yourself a mac.
