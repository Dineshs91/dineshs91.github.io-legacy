Alphabet-frequency is a program i have written using python2.7 which graphically displays the frequency of letters in a specified file. 
You can have a look at https://github.com/Dineshs/alphabet-frequency .

You require matplotlib and numpy modules to run this program.

In the first few lines i have imported the necessary modules. Matplotlib module is used for plotting data. arparse module is used for command line argument parsing. 

There are a lot of options which you can provide. The default option is alphabets(lower and upper case). This is a very simple program. You can understand it by looking at the code itself. Output is a graph which shows how frequently a character appears in a file.
