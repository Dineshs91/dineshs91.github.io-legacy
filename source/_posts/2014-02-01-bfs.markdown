Breadth First Search (BFS).

BFS explores in levels. It explores all the nodes and then moves to the next node unlike DFS which explores the nodes of siblings until a node doesnâ€™t have a sibling. BFS moves like a wave. Here a queue is used.

The path found using BFS is the shortest path. BFS takes less time than DFS to explore. But it can take more memory which depends on the branching factor.
