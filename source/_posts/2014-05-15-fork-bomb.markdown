Bash fork bomb

{% codeblock %}
:(){ :|:& };:
{% endcodeblock %}

Once you type this in bash and press enter, your system will crash.
You have to reboot your system.

:|: - It will call itself using programming technique called recuresion
and pipes the output to another call of the function':'. The worst part 
is function get called two times to bomb your system.

& - Puts the function call in the bachground so child cannot die at all 
and start eating system resources.
