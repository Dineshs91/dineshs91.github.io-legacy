While talking about the power of brain, who can understand it better than
a programmer.

Yes, it's true, a programmer knows what human brain can do.

Most of the programmer's would have got this feeling at some point in their programming
career, god why is it so hard to write a program, but my brain knows how to do it. Our
brain does it instantaneously that we don't know what is happening(the actual logic).
Only if slow down the process, we understand what actually happened.
  

For example, take this problem where you have to print whether a 
given string is a palindrome or not.

BRAIN:

We can say wether it's a palindrome or not, the second we look at it.

COMPUTER:

You have to write a program to verify that. It takes some thinking. 
Then he writes an algorithm.

You can see that brain is faster than computer.

Hey wait, there is a catch !!

There is a cross over point, after which computer becomes faster than brain.

How? Let's take the same example of palindrome. Maybe for smaller inputs brain
is faster, but for larger inputs definitely a computer is faster and
less error prone.

By programming we are just transferring our thinking process to a computer.

So there is nothing more powerful than a human brain in this world.
